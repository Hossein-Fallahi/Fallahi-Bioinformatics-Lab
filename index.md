# Making sense of Cancer and stem cell big data

My lab uses freely available metadata in the field of cancer and stem cells biology to gain insigth regarding molecular pathways in the cell.
We have implemented gene expression and protein-protein netwrok analysis in our previous projects. We aim to include data mining techniques in or future work to gain more power in analysing suhc data.
Our ultimate goal woud be finding new genes, proteins and pathways as target for detection of cancer, drug targets or percision medicine.

We will be more than Happy to have a chat with anyone intersted in these fileds.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
We have implemented multiple Bioinformatics techniques in cancer and stem cell biology to uncover important pathways and genes that are important in these fileds.

Application and codes that have been used or developed in our group would be a good starting point for many who want to conduct similar analysis. We will deposite them in the resource section and padte it regularly.

please visit our github page to look at the codes that we are using. We have modified available codes to better integrate them in our analysis piplines.
