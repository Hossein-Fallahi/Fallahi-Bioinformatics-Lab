# Making sense of Bio/Med big data

ðŸ§¬ About my lab

The Fallahi Bioinformatics Lab at Razi University is a dynamic research lab that integrates knowledge from molecular genetics, systems biology, and artificial intelligence. My team is dedicated to unraveling the molecular mechanisms of aging, cancer, and cellular senescence through integrative omics and machine learning approaches. With a strong foundation in transcriptomic and genomic data analysis, the aim is to develop AI-driven models to decode complex biological networks and identify therapeutic targets. Our interdisciplinary collaborations span cancer biology, regenerative medicine, and neurogenetics, with recent work published in Biogerontology, Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, and PLOS ONE.

I mentor graduate students in the field of bioinformatics, helping them start their research journey in precision medicine and computational biology. 

We will be more than happy to chat with anyone interested in these fields.

Applications and codes that have been used or developed in our group would be a good starting point for many who want to conduct similar analyses. We will deposit them in the resource section and update them regularly.
