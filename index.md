# Making sense of Cancer and stem cell big data

My lab uses freely available metadata in the field of cancer and stem cells biology to address differnt types of questions regarding molecular regulation in the cells.
We have implemented gene expression anlysis and protein-protein interaction networks in our previous projects. Now, we are trying to include data mining approaches in our  works to gain more power in analysing suhc BioMed data.
Our ultimate goal is to find new genes, proteins and pathways as targets for cancer diagnosis, finding new drug targets for percision medicine.

We will be more than Happy to have a chat with anyone intersted in these fileds.

We have implemented multiple Bioinformatics techniques in cancer and stem cell biology to uncover important pathways and genes that are important in these fileds.

Application and codes that have been used or developed in our group would be a good starting point for many who want to conduct similar analysis. We will deposite them in the resource section and padte it regularly.
