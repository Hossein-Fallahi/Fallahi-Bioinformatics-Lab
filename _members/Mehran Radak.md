Mehran was a member of my lab and was analysing gene networks in Cancer. He was interested in using WGCNA to detect key genes involved in many aspects of cancer. Please look at his [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ezYAJ3AAAAAJ&hl=en) for more information. He is currently a PhD student at the University of Queensland, Australia.
