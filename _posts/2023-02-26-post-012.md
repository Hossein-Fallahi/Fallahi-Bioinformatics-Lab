In this [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108(22)00493-7.pdf), Loukas et al. show that loss of many epigenetic regulators, frequently mutated across cancer types, promote subclone expansion by conferring resistance to stressful environments. 
Epigenetically disrupted cells fail to efficiently rewire transcription in response to stress, lowering the probability of cell death at early stages and favoring stochastic population adaptation.
