Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can revolutionize cancer medicine. However, overactivation, lack of tumor-specific surface markers, and antigen escape have hampered CAR T cell development. 
A multi-antigen targeting CAR system regulated by clinically approved pharmaceutical agents is needed. 
Li et al [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1535610822003725?via%3Dihub) has developed a multiplex CAR circuits with advanced functionalities.
