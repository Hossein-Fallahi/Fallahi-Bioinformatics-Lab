This new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)01461-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124722014619%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0070) in Cell Reports discusses the usibility of TLR2 expression for survival analysis in NSCLCin melanoma patients. 
They showed that TLR2 is highly expressed in tumor epithelium and correlates with improved survival and clinical regression
