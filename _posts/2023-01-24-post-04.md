Cancer metastasis is an extremely inefficient process that is limited by numerous stresses tumor cells encounter during the progression from early-stage cancer to metastatic lesions in distant organs.
A class of genes, termed ‘cancer fitness genes’, relieve such stresses to facilitate the development of metastatic disease.(see this [paper](https://www.cell.com/trends/cancer/fulltext/S2405-8033(22)00190-X))
