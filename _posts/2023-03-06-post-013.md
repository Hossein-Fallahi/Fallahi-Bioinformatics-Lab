Metastatic relapse after treatment is the leading cause of cancer mortality, and known resistance mechanisms are missing for most treatments administered to patients. 
To bridge this gap, Pradat et al [Paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0966/718563/Integrative-pan-cancer-genomic-and-transcriptomic) analyzed a pan-cancer cohort (META-PRISM) of 1,031 refractory metastatic tumors profiled via whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing.
They have demonstrated that molecular markers improve six-month survival prediction, particularly in patients with advanced breast cancer.
