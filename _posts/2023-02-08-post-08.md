Screening individuals at high-risk, including those with cirrhosis and viral hepatitis, provides an avenue for improved survival, but current screening methods are inadequate. 
In this [study](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0659/711014/Detecting-liver-cancer-using-cell-free-DNA), whole-genome cell-free DNA fragmentome analyses was used to eveluate the possibility of uusing Cell-Free DNA Fragments for early detction of cancer.
Using a machine learning model that incorporated multi-feature fragmentome data, the sensitivity for detecting cancer was 88% in an average risk population at 98% specificity, and 85% among high-risk individuals at 80% specificity.
