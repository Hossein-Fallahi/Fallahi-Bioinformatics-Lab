Almost all living cells maintain size uniformity through successive divisions. 
Proteins that over and underscale with size can act as rheostats, which regulate cell cycle progression.
New study [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add0636#tab-contributors)combined biochemical profiling technology with mathematical work to show how genetic changes lead to differences in the size of cancer cells.
