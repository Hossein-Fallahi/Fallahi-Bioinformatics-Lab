Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), is known to cause more than 50 diseases. In some cancers, mutations accumulate in short tracts of TRs, a phenomenon termed microsatellite instability; however, larger repeat expansions have not been systematically analysed in cancer.
New findings [Ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05515-1) suggest that rREs may be an important but unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancer, and provide a comprehensive catalogue for further study.
