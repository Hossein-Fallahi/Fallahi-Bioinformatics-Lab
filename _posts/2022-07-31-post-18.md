# New paper 
T cell exhaustion limits antitumor immunity, but the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood.
[Belk et al.](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00231-8) find several genes related to epigenetic modification and show that by eliminating Arid1a, CD8+ T cells retain proliferative and cytotoxic function in vivo, leading to better anti-tumor activity.
