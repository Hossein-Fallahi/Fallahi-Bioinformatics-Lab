# New paper 
In a new paper, Nassar and colleagues find that in solid tumors, tumor-only sequencing leads to an overestimate of the biomarker tumor mutation burden (TMB), particularly in patients of African or Asian ancestry. Correction of the TMB estimate improves the correlation between TMB and response to immunotherapy. [Paper in Cancer Cell](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00386-5)
