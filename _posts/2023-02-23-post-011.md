Increased glucose metabolism and uptake are characteristic of many tumors and used clinically to diagnose and monitor cancer progression. 
In addition to cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) encompasses a wide range of stromal, innate, and adaptive immune cells. 
Cooperation and competition between these cell populations supports tumor proliferation, progression, metastasis, and immune evasion.
In this new [Review Paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(23)00009-0), the authors discussed how metabolic programming of cells within the TME promotes tumor proliferation, progression, and metastasis.
