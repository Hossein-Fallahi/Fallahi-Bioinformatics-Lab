Immunotherapy presented new hopes for melanoma patients; however, resistance to this therapy is an issue for many patients. 
Zhou et al. [see the paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00503-7)propose a mechanism for signal-regulatory protein α1 (SIRPα) expression and describe how its loss may contribute to immunotherapy resistance.
