In this new [paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/83/9/1503/726052/Spatial-Transcriptomics-Depict-Ligand-Receptor?redirectedFrom=fulltext) Generation of spatially resolved gene expression patterns in tumors from patients with ovarian cancer surviving more than 10 years allows the identification of novel predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for better patient management.
