# New paper 

In a recent [paper] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04774-2) it has been established that WNT5A is the central, age-sensitive regulator of the dormancy-to-reactivation axis of melanoma. 
It has been shown that aged fibroblasts in the lungs suppress WNT5A signaling induced at the primary tumor site to awaken dormant melanoma cells and promote the outgrowth of metastases.
