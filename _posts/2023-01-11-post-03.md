Cellular senescence is a stress response that activates innate immune cells, but little is known about its interplay with the adaptive immune system. 
In This [paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0523/710086/Cellular-senescence-is-immunogenic-and-promotes), the authors show that senescent cells combine several features that render them highly efficient in activating dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen-specific CD8 T cells.
