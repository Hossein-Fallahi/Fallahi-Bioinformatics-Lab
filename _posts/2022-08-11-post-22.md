# New paper 
Cellular deconvolution algorithms virtually reconstruct tissue composition by analyzing the gene expression of complex tissues. 
We present the decision tree machine learning algorithm, Kassandra, trained on a broad collection of >9,400 tissue and blood sorted cell RNA profiles incorporated into millions of artificial transcriptomes to accurately reconstruct the tumor microenvironment (TME).
