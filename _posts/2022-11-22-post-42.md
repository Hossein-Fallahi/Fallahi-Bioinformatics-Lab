cTAF accounts for cfDNA cancer signal variation across cancer types and stages. This new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00513-X) has found that cfDNA methylation was the most promising genomic feature for cancer signal detection.
The results informed the development of a cfDNA-based multi-cancer early detection test. Compared with clinical stage and tumor type, cTAF is a more significant predictor of classifier performance and may more closely reflect tumor biology. Clinical LODs mirror relative sensitivities for all approaches. The WG methylation feature best predicts cancer signal origin. 
WG methylation is the most promising technology for MCED and informs development of a targeted methylation MCED test.
