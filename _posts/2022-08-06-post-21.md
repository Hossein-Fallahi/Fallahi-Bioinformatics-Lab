# New paper 
Cancer growth is accompanied by changes to the extracellular environment of tumors, which aids the proliferation and spread of cancer cells. Cancer-associated extracellular matrix changes include excessive degradation of heparan sulfate carbohydrates, promoting metastatic spread by multiple mechanisms. Heparanase is the main human enzyme responsible for extracellular heparan sulfate breakdown and strongly drives metastasis when overexpressed.
