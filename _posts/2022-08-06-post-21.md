# New paper 
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) mediate essential interactions throughout theextracellular matrix (ECM), providing signals that regulate cellular growth and develop-ment. 
A new [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203167119)showed the application  of  cyclophellitol-derived  HPSE  inhibitors  in reduction of cancer aggression in cellulo and significantly ameliorates murine metastasis.
