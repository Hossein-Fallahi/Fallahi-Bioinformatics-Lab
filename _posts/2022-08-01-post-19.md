# New paper 
A new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00847-9) demonstrated that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. 
This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease.
