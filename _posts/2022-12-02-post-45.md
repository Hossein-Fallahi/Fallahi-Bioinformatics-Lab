Mutations in epigenetic regulators are prevalent in cancer, but their functional impact is poorly delineated aside from disrupting differentiation.
Loukas, Simeoni, et al. [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610822004937?via%3Dihub) zoom in on the late occurring, subclonal subset of such mutations and define the molecular mechanism behind their enrichment in cancer.
