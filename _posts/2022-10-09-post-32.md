Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for unresectable and metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). 
However, tumors frequently develop chemoresistance. Here, we established a primary and orthotopic MIBC mouse model with gene-edited organoids to recapitulate the full course of chemotherapy in patients. 
In a new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00374-9), Wang et. al. found that partial squamous differentiation, called semi-squamatization, is associated with acquired chemoresistance in both mice and human MIBCs.
