Various cell-free DNA (cfDNA) features including methylation and genomic profiles migth be useful for detection of cancer. 
The authors of a new paper published in [Cancer Research](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/83/7_Supplement/6697/719084/Abstract-6697-Deep-learning-algorithm-for-cancer), have developed deep learning models based the data generated by the enzymatic conversion based whole methylome sequencing of cfDNA.
