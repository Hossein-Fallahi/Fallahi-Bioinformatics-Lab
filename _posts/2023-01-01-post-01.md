Multiple Myeloma (MM) develops from well-defined precursor stages, however, invasive bone marrow (BM) biopsy limits screening and monitoring strategies for patients.
A new [paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0482/711479/MinimuMM-seq-Genome-sequencing-of-circulating?redirectedFrom=fulltext) developed a novel approach, MinimuMM-seq, which enables detection of translocations and copy number abnormalities through whole-genome sequencing of highly pure CTCs.
