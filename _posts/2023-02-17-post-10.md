A new [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add0636), is using advanced image analysis and DNA/protein examination to investigate the size regulation of melanoma cells.
They found that up-regulation of TP53 or CDKN1A/p21CIP1 is characteristic of proliferative cancer cells with senescent-like sizes/proteomes.
