Loss of epigenetic regulators accelerated tumorigenesis and revealed lineage infidelity and aberrant expression of alveogenesis genes as potential early events in tumorigenesis.
Infrequently mutated genes comprise most of the mutational burden in breast tumors. 
In this [Paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0865/711005/Loss-of-Epigenetic-Regulation-Disrupts-Lineage?redirectedFrom=fulltext) an in vivo CRISPR screening was used to identify functional tumor suppressors realted epigenetic regulation.
Loss of epigenetic regulators accelerated tumorigenesis and revealed lineage infidelity and aberrant expression of alveogenesis genes as potential early events in tumorigenesis.
