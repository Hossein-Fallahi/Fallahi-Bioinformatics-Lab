In melanoma, predicting which tumors will ultimately metastasize guides treatment decisions. 
Transcriptional signatures of primary tumors have been utilized to predict metastasis, but which among these are driver or passenger events remains unclear.
A new [paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0427/711686/Identifying-the-Transcriptional-Drivers-of) revealed GRAMD1B, a cholesterol transfer protein, as a bona fide metastasis suppressor, with a majority of knockout animals rapidly developing metastasis.
