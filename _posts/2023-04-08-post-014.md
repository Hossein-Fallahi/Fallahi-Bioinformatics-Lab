Pediatric solid and central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death among children.
In a new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(23)00080-6), the authors established a single-site collection of 261 cell lines, including 224 pediatric cell lines representing 18 distinct extracranial and brain childhood tumor types. 
They subjected 182 cell lines to multi-omics analyses (DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, DNA methylation), and in parallel performed pharmacological and genetic CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to identify pediatric-specific treatment opportunities and biomarkers.
