Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment. Nevertheless, most cancer patients still do not respond to ICB.
This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153561082200561X?via%3Dihub) demonstrates the critical role of eosinophils in ICB response and provides proof-of-principle for eosinophil engagement to enhance ICB efficacy.
