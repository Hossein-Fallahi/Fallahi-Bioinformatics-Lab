# New paper 
Intratumor microbes, which are present in both tumor and immune cells, have been shown to have multiple effects on human cancer. However, the full scope of usch effect is unknown.
In this new [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00371-3), the authors find that race is a deterministic factor in thois regard.
