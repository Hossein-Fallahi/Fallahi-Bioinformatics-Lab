The hallmarks of cancer [paper](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/12/1/31/675608/Hallmarks-of-Cancer-New-DimensionsHallmarks-of) conceptualization is a heuristic tool for distilling the vast complexity of cancer phenotypes and genotypes into a provisional set of underlying principles.As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements.Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. 
Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment.
