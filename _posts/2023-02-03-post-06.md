A new study published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05394-6) has identified a mechanism that allows cancer cells to spread throughout the body. 
Cancer cells move faster when they are surrounded by thicker fluids, a change that occurs when lymph drainage is disrupted by a primary tumor.
These findings provide a potential new target for stopping metastasis, which is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths.
