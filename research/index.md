# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

The research in my group is mostly related to cancer and stem cells. In addition, to help other researchers, we might get involved in the analysis of other types of data including RNAseq and Microarray in microbiology and plant science.
We are interested in transcriptome network analysis and gene expression under different conditions in various organisms. As documented in our published works, we have designed and implemented numerous pipelines to obtain and analyze available high throughput data.
