# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

The research in my group is primarily focused on cancer and stem cells. In addition, to help other researchers, we might get involved in the analysis of different types of data, including RNAseq and Microarray in microbiology and plant science.
We are interested in analyzing transcriptome networks and gene expression under various conditions in different organisms. As documented in our published works, we have designed and implemented numerous pipelines to obtain and analyze available high-throughput data.
