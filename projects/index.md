# Future projects (lab's new directions):
{:.left}
## 1. Multimodal Omics Integration for Aging Biomarkers
Expand beyond transcriptomics by incorporating epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. The aim is to employ deep learning to identify predictive aging signatures across tissues and disease states.
{:.left}
## 2. Single-Cell AI for Senescence Microenvironment Mapping
Integrate single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to characterize cellular aging. Applying AI-based clustering and trajectory inference to uncover senescence-associated cell states in cancer and neurodegeneration.
{:.left}
## 3. AI-integrated into Drug Repurposing approaches for Age-Related Diseases
Using knowledge generative AI to predict senolytic compounds or rejuvenation therapeutics. To create a pipeline to maximize the advantage of public compound libraries and omics perturbation databases.
{:.left}
## 4. Longitudinal Aging Cohort Modeling
Using European biobank datasets to build longitudinal machine learning models for aging trajectories. The aim is to make predictive tools relevant to precision geriatrics, especially in oncology and chronic inflammation.
{:.left}
## 5. "Digital Twin" Models of Cellular Aging
Develop computational “digital twins” of cells or organ systems using simulations of aging dynamics. Merging molecular expertise with mechanistic modeling to test intervention hypotheses in silico.
{:.left}
## 6. Neurodegenerative Aging Signatures
Diving deeper into aging mechanisms in the brain—associated transcriptomic dysregulation with cognitive decline. Integrating AI tools to bridge molecular patterns with imaging, cognitive scores, and neuroinflammation biomarkers
