# Future projects:
{:.left}
## 1. Multimodal Omics Integration for Aging Biomarkers
Expand beyond transcriptomics by incorporating epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data.

Develop deep learning architectures (e.g., transformers or graph neural networks) to identify predictive aging signatures across tissues and disease states.

## 2. Single-Cell AI for Senescence Microenvironment Mapping
Integrate single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to characterize cellular niches of aging.

Apply AI-based clustering and trajectory inference to uncover senescence-associated cell states in cancer and neurodegeneration.

## 3. AI-Augmented Drug Repurposing for Age-Related Diseases
Use knowledge graphs, diffusion models, and generative AI to predict senolytic compounds or rejuvenation therapeutics.

Create a pipeline leveraging public compound libraries and omics perturbation databases.

## 4. Longitudinal Aging Cohort Modeling
Collaborate on European biobank datasets to build longitudinal machine learning models for aging trajectories.

Aim for predictive tools relevant to precision geriatrics, especially in oncology and chronic inflammation.

## 5. Digital Twin Models of Cellular Aging
Develop computational “digital twins” of cells or organ systems using simulations of aging dynamics.

Merge your molecular expertise with mechanistic modeling to test intervention hypotheses in silico.

## 6. Global Senescence Atlas Initiative
Launch an open-access resource integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic data from diverse populations.

Promote collaborations across institutions to annotate senescence across lifespan and species.

## 7. Neurodegenerative Aging Signatures
Dive deeper into aging mechanisms in the brain—link transcriptomic dysregulation with cognitive decline.

Leverage AI tools to bridge molecular patterns with imaging, cognitive scores, and neuroinflammation biomarkers
